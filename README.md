# RIS-neuron-analysis
RIS neuron extraction backend pipeline

This image processing pipeline performs automated analysis of C. elegans microscopy data to investigate the relationship between RIS neuron activity and sleep behavior. The project implements a multi-stage computational approach for precise neuron identification and activity measurement. 

The system processes microscope images of C. elegans through several key stages:
- Initial image preprocessing and enhancement
- Multi-layer filtering to reduce noise and improve signal detection
- Advanced segmentation algorithms to isolate the RIS neuron
- Automated feature extraction and activity quantification
- Temporal correlation analysis with sleep-wake cycles

The extracted data demonstrates clear patterns between RIS neuron activity peaks and the onset of sleep periods in C. elegans, providing valuable insights into sleep regulation mechanisms in simple nervous systems. 
This pipeline enables:
- High-throughput analysis of neural activity data
- Quantitative assessment of sleep-wake transitions
- Investigation of neural circuits involved in sleep regulation
- Potential screening platform for sleep-affecting compounds

The tools and methodologies developed in this project contribute to our understanding of fundamental sleep mechanisms and may have broader applications in neuroscience research and sleep studies.
